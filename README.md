National Ballot Initiatives should be a thing in this country. If 500,000 people sign a petition between every other general election either virtually on the federal government’s petitioning website, the proposed law must be brought to the house and senate to vote on it. If the house and/or senate fails to vote on it either by not being brought up to vote before the general election, or they fail to get 51% of votes in either chamber, it will be put on the ballot after the partisan federal offices that are up for a vote as a ballot initiative. If a plurality of people vote yes, the proposed law becomes law without the need of a signature of the president or approval of congress and congress would need 3/5ths of both chambers to repeal the law. 
A constitutional amendment ballot initiative would require 2,000,000 people to sign a petition in the same ways as the simple law except the time requirement is doubled.

If the population votes in favor by 60% or more then it is passed and made an amendment of the constitution of the United States of America.
